				Rep. Charlie Rangel gave new meaning to the term sweatsuit last week. The congressman stopped at the opening of a new Blink Fitness — a sister gym to Equinox — on 125th Street in Harlem for a ribbon-cutting ceremony and to pose for photos with the spot’s staff. While touring the 16,000-square-foot facility and its 100 pieces of cardio equipment, Rangel spotted a rowing machine and decided to jump on for a mini-workout while wearing his natty gray suit, pressed white shirt and floppy bow tie. Spies said Rangel, 83, barely broke a sweat and explained to onlookers that he’s been rehabbing a back injury and is quite at home on a rowing machine. A video revealed good form, although we’re not quite sure how far he’d get with his stroke speed.	dcf6d30774f64ba7207dd092f1c5cdbd

The player who takes the frisbee can not run or walk and only have 10 seconds to throw the frisbee. They can only move one foot. The time is counted by one opponente player. The defender must, at least, stay three metres from the attacker. Your team scores a point when a player takes the frisbee in the end zone. If the frisbee drops the game goes on.

				Wauwatosa officials are considering providing $2 million to pay for an underground parking structure for ABB Inc.’s proposed office in the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee’s Innovation Park.

				Quick Reference (1834–85), British photographer and inventor, and a colourful character who deserves to be remembered for more than the photomechanical process that bears his name. Born in Manchester, he was brought up by his maternal grandfather. Following a scientific education and apprenticeship in a patent office, he suddenly left England for the Australian goldfields. After various mundane jobs, he took up a post at the Melbourne waterworks which allowed him to practise wet-collodion photography and become a professional photographer. He moved to Java in 1858, where he opened a studio and sent many fine views back to England. [...] From The Oxford Companion to the Photograph in Oxford Reference.

While Bacchus only provided a snippet, it was enough to wet my erotic curiosity. Upon reading the full story by E.T. Costello, I was left… unfulfilled. Not because of the story or the writing (it is excellent!) — but because I was now confused. You see, Bacchus had claimed that the satyr’s partner was, in his opinion, a silkie. And that rathe

ds (also on YouTube). Nearly an hour of delight only blighted by me wishing I could share this spectacular blend of storytelling and music with my great-gran. Once morning came, I called my mother to ask her about great-gran & her stories of women from the sea. At first, mother was a bit dismissive, saying, “You would know better than anyone what she said – you were re-lent-less in having her tell stories!” But once pressed, Mom did recall great-gran calling them selkies. “Did great-gran have a "	acbaaecf2296946e458848586a706662

				Founded in 2014, Men I Trust, is an indie band from Montreal (Canada) composed of Jessy (bass/ guitar), Dragos (keyboards) and Emma (vocals/ guitar). With smooth, chin-bouncing rhythms & bass lines, warm guitars and alluringly subdued vocals, longevity – in all its forms – is an underlying theme in their craft. At its most spacious, listening to Men I Trust feels like you’re gliding on a never-ending wave; at its tightest, they still provide pockets of time to catch your breath. Men I Trust will release their third full-length album in early 2019, with more tour dates to be announced soon. Watch these spaces for more information:	687315df36c92c0e9ff020e024f3e658
