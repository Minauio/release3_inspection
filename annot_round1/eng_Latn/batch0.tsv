The congressman stopped at the opening of a new Blink Fitness — a sister gym to Equinox — on 125th Street in Harlem for a ribbon-cutting ceremony and to pose for photos with the spot’s staff. While touring the 16,000-square-foot facility and its 100 pieces of cardio equipment, Rangel spotted a rowing machine and decided to jump on for a mini-workout while wearing his natty gray suit, pressed white shirt and floppy bow tie. Spies said Rangel, 83, barely broke a sweat and explained to onlookers that he’s been rehabbing a back injury and is quite at home on a rowing machine. A video revealed good form, although we’re not quite sure how far he’d get with his stroke speed.	dcf6d30774f64ba7207dd092f1c5cdbd

(1834–85), British photographer and inventor, and a colourful character who deserves to be remembered for more than the photomechanical process that bears his name. Born in Manchester, he was brought up by his maternal grandfather. Following a scientific education and apprenticeship in a patent office, he suddenly left England for the Australian goldfields. After various mundane jobs, he took up a post at the Melbourne waterworks which allowed him to practise wet-collodion photography and become a professional photographer. He moved to Java in 1858, where he opened a studio and sent many fine views back to England.

Bad hires can cost as much as 30% of their annual salary! There is a better way to build your team that will end up saving your time, money and headache in the long run:

Miller set out on the bike with two purposes in mind. He is recording video interviews asking people ‘If money was not object, how would you pursue your passion?’ He also is hoping to raise money for his charity ‘Let’s Have a Ball.’

	1		1	"World of Art: Outsider Art Thames & Hudson
Outsider Art is the work produced outside the mainstream of modern art by self-taught, untrained visionaries, spiritualists, recluses, folk artists, psychiatric patients, prisoners and others beyond the imposed margins of society and the art market. Coined by Roger Cardinal in 1972, the term in English derived from Jean Dubuffet's 'Art Brut' - literally 'raw art', 'uncooked' by culture, unaffected by fashion, unmoved by artistic standards.
In this comprehensive and indispensable guide, Colin Rhodes surveys the history and reception of Outsider Art - first championed by Dubuffet and the Surrealists, now appreciated by a wider public - while providing fresh insights into the achievements of both major figures and newly discovered artists as well as the emergence of specialized studios, as the relationship between outsider art and the contemporary mainstream art world has developed and become more intertwined. From spirit-guided Madge Gill toschizophrenic Adolf Wolfli, Rosemarie Koczy's expressions of trauma to Nek Chand's outdoor creations, these individuals passionately and obsessively pursue the pictorial expression of their vision.
Now illustrated in full colour, with the exception of some archival photographs, this new edition has been substantially revised with a greater focus on global Outsider art as well as including more recent talents to the field.

When you as a ""pastor"" choose to abandon clear Bible doctrines, you are not longer fit to be shepherding peoples' souls. All preachers, especially pastors, are called to be ""watchmen on the wall"". The day that the watchman decides that the threat of God's judgment isn't really a threat, he does a grave, and possibly eternally grave disservice to those he is supposed to be ministering to.

Tembo came out last week saying the league was still up for grabs but now a loss for his team against Mamelodi Sundowns on Wednesday could take them out of contention for the title.
Matsatsantsa played to a goalless draw against Rise and Shin and are currently sitting sixth on the log, 10 points behind leaders Orlando Pirates but with two games in hand.
""I think the two points dropped was a setback, obviously this is not the right time to drop points,"" said Tembo.
""I was happy with the performance. We haven't played for almost a month and we didn't look sharp especially in the final third.
""We should have wrapped up the game in the first half, we created many chances to win the game but in the final third we were not that sharp.""
SuperSport are set to welcome back striker Mxolisi Macuphu when they visit Sundowns at Loftus Stadium. Macuphu missed the Polokwane City game due to suspension."	e301d53cd7f4dff12911f2d9ca6a12fe

All-purpose fertilizers have ratios that vary from brand to brand, as it claims to be useful for all sorts of plants. They have vastly different ratios, but what they do have in common is a high ratio of nitrogen.

For basil, you can add fertilizer to it every 4 to 6 weeks. It will boost the leaf production in your plant, providing you with large healthy leaves for a delicious meal.
If you are growing basil from seed, you can fertilize the seedlings once a week with very diluted, balanced fertilizer so as to give the seedlings a boost to grow better."	04431940bec07650bce55fa9af068c7b

Heathers - 80's/early 90's Winona Ryder is the best. It's a shame that her career didn't pan out as well as her peers.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince - I have a love/hate relationship with the cinematography of this movie. This was shot very well, but I think the cinematography is trying to make up for the lack of content the story has. The movie was amazing to look at, but it's a kind of story that doesn't benefit from that kind of shooting.
Moana - This was funny and amazing, probably my favorite animated film of the year.
A Fish Called Wanda - I'm glad I know almost nothing about the plot because this was confusing in a fun way.

His companion, a 92-year-old woman, lives in the home and was not hurt, but said she is upset.

Explanation: M33 is a big, beautiful spiral galaxy a mere 3 million light-years away, understandably a popular target for enthusiastic astro-imagers. Just as understandably, interfering satellite trails and airplane streaks that are becoming more common in planet Earth's busy night sky are processed out of their finished images. But Robert Stephan left these streaks in his final picture of M33, realizing that he had also recorded something relatively rare. His otherwise cosmic skyscape shows the tail of an aircraft passing overhead through his telescope's field of view. A navigational strobe light on the plane flashed across the tail at exactly the right moment. The brief illumination produced the incongruous, though remarkably sharp image.

Prayer forms
Christian prayer is composed of various forms:
- Blessing – we bless God who first blesses us.

- Petition – we ask God for his Kingdom to come, to forgive our sins, and for all our spiritual and material needs.

Christian prayer is either:

- Devotional – when Christians unite themselves to God through Christ by means of Christian prayers and devotions e.g. morning prayers or praying the Stations of the Cross.

1) All the paints like Asian has different types of paints based on various factors -apex ultima, apex exterior emulsion,apex duracast etc. Which one should i chose if I need a good finish and reasonably long last?
2) How much does it cost to paint exterior of a house of approx 3200 sq feet ( I know it is difficult but a rough estimate would do including labour and good choice of paint)?

The Gift of Knitted Gift Giving, Part 2 (How Did You Do THAT?!)
My grandmother is 80 something, rather

The Old Police House in Hyde Park is instantly recognisable to visitors to the park. The police house was built in the 1870’s and remains a working police station to this day. It is sometimes described as the beating heart of the park.
As a listed building, we were required to replace the old sliding sash windows in the Old Police House whilst retaining the look of the old historic elevations of the building. We had to match the sightlines of existing windows and doors. We worked closely with local conservation to design and approve replacement windows. We accommodated the working police by installing only outside of working ours – mainly at weekends – leaving the station ready for use on the Monday morning.
We successfully completed the contract over several months before leaving the Old Police House looking as it had done before, but with modern windows and doors installed. We have since replaced windows and doors across many of the historic buildings in the Royal Parks.

This fund allows us to support our students who are in danger of withdrawing due to an unexpected, temporary financial hardship as a result of illness, family crisis, natural disaster, or other emergency or crisis situations. The fund is intended to assist UA students by providing subsidies solely for unexpected emergency expenses. To learn more about the Richard H. Tyler Student Emergency Fund, click here.
Additionally, the Campus Pantry is still serving students who remain in the residence halls and in Tucson. They are providing food to over 150 students each distribution day and are committed to remaining open while restaurants are closing, and grocery stores are limited on what’s available.

By Now Lyrics
Bet she's been crying all night long
By now her heart is surely breaking
Just like this cold gray Georgia dawn
By now she knows how much she needs me
'Cause she can't make it on her own
By now she thinks I really miss her
But I've hardly noticed she was gone
And any minute now that phone is gonna ring
She'll say let's work it out somehow
But time keeps dragging on, what's taking her so long?
I should've heard from her by now
By now she's slipped into her night gown
She's letting down her soft brown hair
By now she needs someone to hold her
And I know she's wishing I was there
And any minute now that phone is gonna ring
And she'll say let's work it out somehow
But time keeps dragging on, what's taking her so long?
I should've heard from her by now
By now I know how much I love her

The two Web multimillionaires had never crossed paths, but when Russell C. Horowitz and Frank Schilling finally met to talk business three years ago, the summit began in style - sipping soft drinks poolside at the Four Seasons Las Vegas and chatting about private jets.
Horowitz, a ponytailed 38-year-old at the time, had made his fortune as the founder of a bubble-era darling called Go2Net, which he sold for $1.6 billion. Schilling, whose regular attire is designer surfwear, made his mint in secrecy as a domain-name investor working out of an ocean-front condo in the Caymans.

Tristan shows two different types of personality: Tristan can appear as phlegmatic and relatively immobile like his plant mascot, the plane tree, but he can also seem quite dynamic like his animal mascot, the tit, the bringer of messages.

	1		1	"When is an accident a criminal act? When is an execution really brutal murder?
Two shootings that Meredith Carroll mentions in the Denver Post on Sunday were, indeed, accidental by some definitions.
A police officer accidentally shot his teen daughter in their garage; a woman in Florida accidentally shot her 7-year-old grandson. They were unfortunate events, to put it mildly, that resulted from carelessness. They were also by far the most common type of accident: the ones that can be prevented.
That the shootings were in some sense accidental doesn’t mean those who pulled the triggers are blameless. They pulled the triggers quite intentionally with horrific, unintentional results. There is, or should be, a legal price to pay. We should also find a better word than “accident” to describe such things.
Similarly, the media have almost universally described the beheading of journalist James Foley as an execution.
More precisely, it was murder.
I disagree with the idea the first two shootings were accidental.
A better word to describe them is “negligent”.
It is a person’s responsibility to identify if another is a threat; it appears neither of the first two did that. They were negligent in their actions.

Do you know that feeling, when you really need to find something you have seen a long time ago? And no, I'm talking not about socks.
I remember myself playing this a bit childish, but in some ways awesome game, where you control a tank, and can pick up and stack turrets (and maybe something else) from enemy tanks you kill. Maybe they also had different platforms (and if it's one with wheels then technically it's not a tank, but hey). It was around 2000 (or maybe even earlier) and the game had 3D graphics.
In summary:
- PC game
- 3D graphics (although with very low polygon count).
- Top-down view, almost everything on one screen (so, not huge maps).
- A bit childish: colorful, the sounds are funny as well, especially engines.
- Stacked turrets on top of each other on top of tank-like things, you control one of them, and can pick up more turrets from killed enemies.
- World with water and other obstacles.
- If you have a lot of stacked turrets on your tank, it slows down.
Please help me find this game, so I know that i'm not crazy (at least, not in a can't-remember-a-name-of-an-awesome-game-of-my-youth way).
Answer
The game you are thinking of is Tanktics. I agree, it was an awesome game of my youth! My personal favorite part was the sheep-powered tank part factory.

Asking yourself a few questions before planting will set your garden up for success. Not all plants will grow in all conditions, each plant has specific environmental needs. It’s important to understand the growing conditions in your garden to determine which plants will thrive in your environment and how to best utilize your space.

- Amend the Soil: Healthy plants need healthy soil so the first step is to determine what type of soil you have. If needed, amend your soil with compost for added nutrients. Always use a fresh bag of soil for containers. Remember to mix well, you want to give the roots nutrients in every layer of soil.
