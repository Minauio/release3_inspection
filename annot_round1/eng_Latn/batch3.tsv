				Copywriter, UX writer, technical author, web editor... it's slightly ironic an industry of wordsmiths have so many titles for themselves. Then, in 2011 Sarah Richards created the term 'Content Design' for the Government Digital Service and added another term to the industry lexicon. It caused a lot of consternation in government at the time. Which was the point. The reason was quite clear: government had to change the way it considered the skill of communicating. GOV.UK was not mucking around. Sarah will explain why changing the name was important at the time, the process of content design, the impact it has and how it has changed content production around the world. Sarah will share examples of how a single word can stop a multi-million pound service dead in its tracks, why you should have a content person at discovery and how content can make or break service design.	f50f709ff4c2efeb4878b880e9bf242c

				My Nonprofit Reviews Hank W. Review for Sun Valley Jazz Jamboree, Battle Ground, WA, USA Great people putting on an outstanding festival in a wondrous setting. We have gone for 5 years and it is always one of the best events of the year. The SVJJ goes to great effort to promote jazz with younger generations and it is evident each year as new groups come to the festival. They also go into the community and work with the schools and churches to promote jazz. A great combination of entertainment and doing good. Was your donation impactful? Definitely How likely is it that you would recommend that a friend donate to this group? Definitely How likely are you to donate to this group again?

				City of Colorado Springs / Stormwater / Projects / Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) / Fountain Boulevard and Chelton RoadFountain Boulevard and Chelton Road The intersection of Fountain Boulevard and Chelton Road historically flooded even during small rain events. Runoff that fell here or collected from surrounding areas used the streets to drain to Spring Creek. Growth over the years increased the runoff to the point where the streets couldn't convey the water fast enough. The solution was to install an underground pipe system to carry the water to Spring Creek including extensive drainage work at the intersection. This project was completed in November 2009. For efficiency, the project was combined with a traffic safety improvement project which was funded with a Federal grant. Stormwater Enterprise Funding: $750,000	b95c7293a2a579a8f1356135088d0c2b

				"Published December 20, 2010 advertisement PUEBLO, Colo. – A Colorado man who wrote a how-to guide for pedophiles is being transferred to Florida to face obscenity charges, after deputies there ordered a copy of the book that has generated online outrage. Officers on Monday arrested Phillip R. Greaves at his home in Pueblo on a warrant that charges him with violating Florida's obscenity law. Greaves has waived his right to fight extradition to Polk County, Fla. Pueblo County Sheriff's Deputy Laurie Kilpatrick says Greaves has left Colorado, but he declined to give details of Greaves' transfer. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd says his office can arrest Greaves because he sold and mailed his self-published book directly to undercover Polk deputies. The deputies had written Greaves a letter seeking a copy of the book, called ""The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure: a Child-lover's Code of Conduct."" http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/12/20/author-pedophilia-book-arrested/"	d9ceba1b59abb4a8a3d73f32b885dc79

				Dog Walkers, Please … The Parish Council has received complaints from landowners of people walking around their fields with dogs, rather than sticking to the public rights of way. Some dog owners are reported to be letting their pet loose and allowing them to foul in the fields, which has led to farm animals being harmed and, in a couple of cases, killed. If you are lucky enough to own a dog, please remember: - Although there is no actual rule requiring that dogs must be kept on a lead whilst on a public right of way, there is a requirement that they are kept under control and confined to the line of the path. - You must at all times remove and responsibly dispose of any dog mess.

Came to Call Mine is an extensive full-color art book by visionary musician, artist, and writer Graham Lambkin. Playing out like a children's book for adults, Came to Call Mine features 50 hand-drawn illustrations coupled with simplistic corresponding texts. Lambkin's mischievous combination of figurative and abstract elements lends Came to Call Mine a jarring, dreamlike quality, confusing the eye by placing innocent childlike totems against a darker adult undercurrent. Came to Call Mine is released as a deluxe softcover book designed by Maja Larsson, with lithograph printing on Munken pure rough, lynx, and polar paper stock in an edition of 400 copies.
