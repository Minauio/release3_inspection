				"Copywriter, UX writer, technical author, web editor... it's slightly ironic an industry of wordsmiths have so many titles for themselves. Then, in 2011
Sarah Richards created the term 'Content Design' for the Government Digital Service and added another term to the industry lexicon.
It caused a lot of consternation in government at the time.
Which was the point.
The reason was quite clear: government had to change the way it considered the skill of communicating. GOV.UK was not mucking around.
Sarah will explain why changing the name was important at the time, the process of content design, the impact it has and how it has changed content production around the world.
Sarah will share examples of how a single word can stop a multi-million pound service dead in its tracks, why you should have a content person at discovery and how content can make or break service design."	f50f709ff4c2efeb4878b880e9bf242c

Dan & Roy ordered the Nasi Lemak Ayam while Shum had the 5-Spice Chicken Set (Sorry…no pic. Shum dug in before I could whip out my camera…teehee). I ordered the Penang Curry Laksa and a bowl of cendol.My curry laksa (I opted for kuay teow) was not bad. The curry broth was thick yet not cloying and spicy with a hint of sweetness from the coconut milk.

Very fragrant with hints of “burnt” smell. It gave the curry the extra oomph. I almost emptied the whole pot (small pot only la).My cendol came drizzled with thick palm sugar and creamy coconut milk.

 what I was expecting (and more). A motor race, with guns. Giggled at the South African references. Tsotsi's shooting at random vehicles, hot local chicks and even a violent protest. Some randomly thrown in nude scenes (raised my rating from a 7), and not a bad soundtrack.
For the full experience, I recommend smoking some swaz or cheese.

				"It`s a nice idea
But what about the personnel?
This is not about any player that Chelsea is linked to, but just considering an article I read here about Chelsea using an alternative 4-4-2 formation.
It`s a nice idea, it will give us another option and will make us unpredictable to teams before games but it will not be possible with the current type of players we have got, recently I have been reading some reports that Ba and Torres can't play together, well to some extent that's true, because none would be able to do what Aguero or Rooney does for City or United.
Aguero or Rooney plays behind the main striker and also falls so deep to assist the midfield adding both strength and number to both attack and midfield. To some extent the only player that could do that for Chelsea is maybe Hazard, but I still don't believe he will be so efficient as a supporting striker in a 4-4-2 formation!
If Rafa Benitez has the intention of using a 4-4-2 formation, the only possible option is getting a striker like Jovetic that could play behind the striker, on the wings or as a false 9, players like Jovetic are so efficient playing behind the main striker in a 4-4-2 formation, Taison or Aspas would have been a good buy, but they look beyond our reach.
It`s a great idea though but I would love to see what Chelsea are up to for the remainder of this transfer window.

While this strikingly well-made film is a great calling card for rising-star filmmaker Norris, it's also so relentlessly dark and unsettling that it's difficult to see the point of it all. This is such a bleak coming-of-age tale that it almost obscures any hope at all, focussing a series of horrific incidents into a confined space that gives the actors and filmmaker a change to shine, but leaves the audience exhausted.

And Skunk's world seems to be limited to her street and a junkyard across the field.

Anna,
Blessings to you! I am so sorry that it has taken me so long to write to you. I have wanted to update you and thank you for some time now.
I cannot thank you enough for helping me to get pregnant last fall. You were so instrumental to my growth at such a difficult time as I was transitioning out of a very difficult work situation, navigating cutting my finances in half, getting out of a state of depression, and with the hopes of getting pregnant. Receiving acupuncture and encouragement/wise words from you was so crucial and beneficial. As you know, I became pregnant after several treatments from you--ahead of schedule. You believed when I had lost hope in becoming pregnant and you brought me so much hope as a result. In January, I gave birth to our daughter, Arabella, who was a whopper at 10 pounds! She is perfect and healthy. She is nearing 5 months old now. I can't thank you enough--how can you ever thank someone enough for helping to give you the gift of life, and more importantly, a long desired child? Thank you, Anna, from the bottom of my heart!
I do apologize for not being in to tell you this news sooner.
With love and gratefulness,

Great people putting on an outstanding festival in a wondrous setting. We have gone for 5 years and it is always one of the best events of the year. The SVJJ goes to great effort to promote jazz with younger generations and it is evident each year as new groups come to the festival. They also go into the community and work with the schools and churches to promote jazz. A great combination of entertainment and doing good.

I’ve mostly been inspired by the work Nat and Chloe have been doing with the seeds I helped plant on the farm last month. But of course they get decent sunshine, so that’s why I’m sticking with herbs in the seedling format and nothing more:
So we now have basil, chives, continental parsley, strawberries, afro parsley and coriander. We already had standard mint, which I’ve tried to resurrect. I also repotted the aloe vera (‘ALLO VERA!) in the hope that it doesn’t die a slow and painful death. Vera saved me when I had severe sunburn in about 2003, so I vowed to protect the breed wherever possible.
I also bought some cat mint and cat grass in the hopes of turning Elvis and Bear COMPLETELY PSYCHO, which is yet to happen, but it’s early days yet.

Abstract
Purpose: Retinal microvascular abnormalities measured on retinal images are a potential source of prognostic biomarkers of vascular changes in the neurodegenerating brain. We assessed the presence of these abnormalities in Alzheimer's dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using ultra-widefield (UWF) retinal imaging.
Methods: UWF images from 103 participants (28 with Alzheimer's dementia, 30 with MCI, and 45 with normal cognition) underwent analysis to quantify m

ing.
Conclusions: Statistically significant differences in the retinal vasculature in peripheral regions of the retina were observed among the distinct cognitive stages. However, larger studies are required to establish the clinical importance of our findings. UWF imaging may be a promising modality to assess a larger view of the retinal vasculature to uncover retinal changes in Alzheimer's disease.

Currently on cycle day #57. This is the 3rd day past since I’ve finished my Provera. And I still don’t have anything! No spotting, no cramps, nothing to indicate that AF might be in my near future.
I’m trying not to get discouraged but it just feels like nothing is working for me! I know it’s still too early to throw in the towel on Provera but it’s just one of those days (I think it’s a Monday thing).
Since I’m super impatient I’ve been googling natural ways to induce your period.
So far the front runners are:
- Vitamin C
- Parsley tea
I’m not sure I could stomach drinking parsley tea 3-4 times a day so Vitamin C it is! According to what I read, to induce your period you should take 3000mg of Vitamin C a day for no more than 3 days in a row. I bought some Emergen-C dietary supplements (fizzy orange drink) and am drinking it 3 times a day since they are 1000mg each.

				"For the past year or so, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (a division of the Department of Homeland Security) has been conducting an initiative called “Operation in Our Sites,” in which the agency goes after rogue website and seizes their domain names. There’s been a lot of controversy of this – some argue the standards with which the agency uses to determine whether a website is rogue or not are unclear. Through the criticism, ICE has been unapologetic about all the sites it has shut down. Now, Rojadirecta, one of the sites ICE shut down earlier this year, is suing the U.S. government, Homeland Security and ICE. Rojadirecta challenges, among other things, that the siezure violates the First Amendment.

The intersection of Fountain Boulevard and Chelton Road historically flooded even during small rain events. Runoff that fell here or collected from surrounding areas used the streets to drain to Spring Creek. Growth over the years increased the runoff to the point where the streets couldn't convey the water fast enough.
The solution was to install an underground pipe system to carry the water to Spring Creek including extensive drainage work at the intersection. This project was completed in November 2009. For efficiency, the project was combined with a traffic safety improvement project which was funded with a Federal grant.

PUEBLO, Colo. – A Colorado man who wrote a how-to guide for pedophiles is being transferred to Florida to face obscenity charges, after deputies there ordered a copy of the book that has generated online outrage.
Officers on Monday arrested Phillip R. Greaves at his home in Pueblo on a warrant that charges him with violating Florida's obscenity law. Greaves has waived his right to fight extradition to Polk County, Fla.
Pueblo County Sheriff's Deputy Laurie Kilpatrick says Greaves has left Colorado, but he declined to give details of Greaves' transfer.
Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd says his office can arrest Greaves because he sold and mailed his self-published book directly to undercover Polk deputies. The deputies had written Greaves a letter seeking a copy of the book, called ""The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure: a Child-lover's Code of Conduct.""

				"According to Zalebs, a University of Cape Town cinematography graduate and part-time musician Yoza Mnyanda got a popurlar DJ, Black Coffee to do a song with her.
A few weeks ago, she tweeted a video of herself performing an original song called Save you From Me on campus. She later retweeted it on her birthday and asked Black Coffee how many retweets of her video she needed for him to consider working with her.
Without wasting anytime Black Coffee simply replied ""let's do it,"" presumably after seeing the video. Black Coffee then sent out a separate tweet to arrange the meeting, this time asking Greg Nate of Soulistic Music to help arrange studio time for the collaboration.
Speaking to Huffington Post South Africa, Mnyanda said she got the idea that morning while listening to Black Coffee's song on the radio.
She then jokingly asked her boyfriend what he would think if she asked Black Coffee to work with her. He encouraged her to do it and well, you know what happened after that...
The studio session went down this past Monday and Mnyanda shared a short video of her chat with Black Coffee.
However, the song has been reported that it won’t be released as a single, it will be available in Black Coffee's next album instead."	3b140fcd2044e116660d011a3376e636

A Voice for Lil Olive is a new documentary from award-winning filmmaker Pete Schuermann. The film explores the special bond between pets and their families, and how rescued dogs change lives. The film's mission is to make people aware of and to change attitudes about rescued pets through the telling of Lil Olive’s tale. In this way, she becomes the voice for so many dogs and animals in need."	9f3940ba8dd263ccf9faf1f48d20c805

It is a very skewed metric to say the least. To say ""get RB so and so 20 carries and you win"" isn't true. Without those turnovers Rice's 21/61 rushing day loses the game for us.

I am stressed from the late-comers but gleeful that it is not as harried as that of previous years. The students have done well. They are largely ""done"", crossed all the t's....So happy.We have had a somewhat peaceful Christmas.
They have come in with their packages. Do remember, it is $800 per package for mailing and $300 for the small envelopes. What goes in: Financial aid forms, copies of passports, birth certificates for some, CXC and CAPE results, preliminary forms will do...
Essays are still being written, but oh, well.....
I am happy that organization and time management are panning out brilliantly.
Happy Christmas and a Wonderful New Year.....

				"Not exactly a rumor, but worth a mention. This type of thing is common when teams meet up for a series. We saw it with Aaron Rowand when the White Sox played the Phillies this year.
Though the Phillies tattooed Dontrelle Willis Sunday night, Willis’s friend Jimmy Rollins and teammate Brett Myers were discussing how they’d love to see him in a Phillies uniform. Rollins suggested that Willis may be unmotivated in Florida. He also added that he’s asked Dontrelle and confirmed that the pitcher would

ade $6.45MM in ’07. The Fish had a $30MM payroll on Opening Day of this year, and will owe Miguel Cabrera several million more in 2008. So Willis should account for 20-25% of the payroll.
Will the Marlins pay up for one more year and hope Willis rebuilds his value? Or will they opt to save the money now and trade him this winter? The latter scenario seems more likely. Even with his value at an all-time low it seems the Marlins could get one solid young player for Willis. I speculated recently th

The Phillies are trying to settle their outfield situation for 2008; as you know, Aaron Rowand is a free agent this winter. Salisbury notes that the Phils might be gunshy about acquiring Willis given the whispers of possible health issues. They can’t have another Freddy Garcia trade.

				"(MENAFN - Khaleej Times) The First Circuit of the Misdemeanour Court, Ras Al Khaimah, has sentenced an Asian man to 18 months in jail, followed by deportation, after he was found guilty of committing 10 robberies.
The accused stole copper electric wires from several trading companies and buildings under construction in the emirate.
As per court records, the case dates back to early this year, when the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officers of the RAK Police arrested the accused red-handed while he was stealing electric cables from a trading company site.
The accused admitted to the crime during initial investigations. He also told the police about other electric cables he stole from another company. The suspect was referred to the RAK Public Prosecution for legal action, where he admitted to committing 10 similar robberies. The Court, presided by Chief Judge Fathi Al Qallaa convicted the accused of the charges levelled against him.
In another case, three Asian residents were accused of committing 49 robberies in different areas of RAK.
Court records show that the accused were nabbed red-handed while robbing a shop. The CID got information that the three suspects were seen frequenting expensive night clubs even though their monthly salaries were low. On being arrested the suspects pleaded guilty."	5905e01925aa7589ef141fad18b4cbf9

Suh was dominant last season next to arguably the league’s best defensive player in Aaron Donald, finishing with 59 total tackles during his campaign with 4.5 sacks and a pair of fumble recoveries. Now he once again looks poised to cash in during free agency at the start of the new league year.

The bottom line is that Suh’s already made his money in this league and clearly wants a chance at a Super Bowl ring, meaning he may be inclined to accept a reduced deal to join a contender. If he’s willing to take a slight pay cut, this would seem to be a match made in heaven for the Chargers, but if he wants a large bag, the team is better off seeking elsewhere."	0ff0af6f4735294573928729ff712af3

Then it starts to grow, even before she meets you.
She loves you with out boundaries.
She held your hand when you were scared.
Wiped your tears when you cried.
She stands with you during your proudest moments
and holds you during your lowest.
She gives without asking and sacrifices without fear.
The love of a mother is endless and timeless.
The love of a mother shines through the foggiest of days.
The love of a mother is a piece of your soul.

				"Ladies! Set your makeup!
I never realized how important this was until recently. I wondered why my face had that extra shine, or why it didn't last as long. Then it came to me -- setting powder! It just brings together your entire look and it gives your makeup a more natural look. Wonder why people think your face is caked? Try to use a more natural looking foundation/concealer and set your makeup with some powder!!
My favorite one is the MAC Mineralized Skin Finish in Medium Plus. It works really well even if you do not have foundation as it helps give you an even coverage all over your face. It is a little expensive but definitely work every single penny.
The Revlon powders are really good as well! I have used the PhotoReady translucent powder and I have tried out the ColorStay as well. I can definitely say that Revlon is one of my favorite drugstore brands and the setting powders work really well!
So ladies, find your match and use it! You will notice a HUGE difference!

As far as the history of sitcoms go, its no Cheers or Seinfeld, but its much much better than average. If you have any type of ability to judge sitcoms, compared to others in the genre, its better than average quality is completely obvious. However, if your standards are ever so unattainable because your a snarky douchebag, then I see your point.

Julian Nagelsmann (Top 2 candidate, is german,considered a ""wunderkid"" but he is only 30)
Willy Sagnol (guy who will be in charge will waiting for a new manager, might suprise us and keep the job)
Jurgen Klopp (unlikely because of his rivality with Bayern and the fact he seem happy at Liverpool)
Ralph Hasenhuttl (took Leipzig to second position in the team first year in Bundesliga)
Lucien Favre (plenty of experience in Bundesliga and with young talent could be enough to convince Bayern)
Leonardo Jardim (unlikely as he is apreciated in Monaco and there is also the fact he has no german experience)
Manuel Pellegrini (unlikely imo)
Luis Enrique (he is free and could be seen as the logical replacement to continue the work Pep did at Bayern)
Joachim Low (would be ideal but he won't leave Germany national team now)
Max Allegri (unlikely as he still is doing great work with Juventus)
Pal Dardai (after what he did with Herta Berlin, Bayern might be tempted to give him a go)
Louis Van Gaal (mentioned but as a very unlikely target)

The Parish Council has received complaints from landowners of people walking around their fields with dogs, rather than sticking to the public rights of way.
Some dog owners are reported to be letting their pet loose and allowing them to foul in the fields, which has led to farm animals being harmed and, in a couple of cases, killed.
If you are lucky enough to own a dog, please remember:
- Although there is no actual rule requiring that dogs must be kept on a lead whilst on a public right of way, there is a requirement that they are kept under control and confined to the line of the path.
- You must at all times remove and responsibly dispose of any dog mess.

				"Acciona Windpower, a company dedicated to the design, manufacture, and sale of wind turbines, has begun the supply of 100 AW 116/3000 wind turbines for a wind power complex in Texas managed by the global asset manager, Capital Dynamics.
The wind turbines will be installed in the Green Pastures wind complex, which is located on more than 18,000 acres in Baylor and Knox Counties in North Texas. They are equipped with 116-m diameter rotors and will be mounted on 92-m high steel towers.
Supplies have already begun and the first phase, with a capacity of 150 MW, is expected to be operational in March 2015. Capital Dynamics and Prudential Capital Group have already completed the financing for this first phase of the Green Pastures wind complex. Acciona Windpower will also provide operation and maintenance services for 10 years.
Acciona Windpower has signed contracts for the sale of AW 3000 wind turbines in Brazil, the United States, Mexico, Canada, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, Chile, and Poland. This contract means that Acciona Windpower will accumulate more than 1,200 MW supplied or contracted for wind farms in the United States, in different models of its 1.5 and 3 MW capacity platforms.

I installed the new dependency libvdpau from SBo, although it can be compiled from the script in -current, too. Similarly, I re-compiled and upgraded electricsheep and xscreensaver to their versions in -current.
Everything seems to work just fine, however Electricsheep would display the sheep in a 4:3 fullscreen ratio. I do not know why, may be I missed something. I searched a bit, but could not find a solution, so I decided to modify the [default]
profile of MPlayer, by editing ~/.mplayer/config
as follows:
# Write your default config options here! [smplayer] # Disable screensaver. heartbeat-cmd=""xscreensaver-command -deactivate >&- 2>&- &"" [default] panscan=1.0 #
This workaround does the job: it scales the video to fit the screen. Note that there should be an empty line below it. I did not find a way to specify a custom profile to be used with Electricsheep, so this should apply for everything that MPlayer runs. The [smplayer]
profile was discussed previously.

A thermojet is a rudimentary type of jet engine. At its heart is an ordinary piston engine, but instead of this driving a propeller, it drives a compressor.

However, there was no obvious way to stop it once it had taken off, which is a great disadvantage. Unfortunately, because the reactor was unshielded, it was dangerous to be in or around the flight path of the vehicle (although the exhaust itself was not radioactive)."	0b1da136b6d8a1ba9385173085ab7344

				"Why Parents Should Encourage Students to Play Outside This Summer
Tomorrow is August 1st. For anyone who operates on an academic calendar, turning to the next page of a calendar page also means preparing for the start of the upcoming school year. With less than a month of summer remaining, now is the time to be strategic about how to spend what time is left of summer.
According to some child development experts, that time should be spent playing. An article published by Upworthy last month examines some of the many benefits children receive by spending time playing outside. Some of these advantages include improvements in concentration, mood, emotional intelligence, creativity, health, and more.
When children’s summers are over-scheduled, they may miss out on the opportunity to just be a kid and play. Similarly, children without structured activities all summer may get into the habit of staying inside instead of going outside to play. So parents, whenever your children complain of boredom this summer, encourage them to find somewhere safe to play outside!

				"""C05"" presents an 18-minute composition, which draws from the texts and themes of Came to Call Mine, presenting a strange lattice of fragmented narration and juvenile musical vision. Came to Call Mine is an extensive full-color art book by visionary musician, artist, and writer Graham Lambkin. Playing out like a children's book for adults, Came to Call Mine features 50 hand-drawn illustrations coupled with simplistic corresponding texts. Lambkin's mischievous combination of figurative and abstract elements lends Came to Call Mine a jarring, dreamlike quality, confusing the eye by placing innocent childlike totems against a darker adult undercurrent.
Came to Call Mine is released as a deluxe softcover book designed by Maja Larsson, with lithograph printing on Munken pure rough, lynx, and polar paper stock in an edition of 400 copies.
