				Benchmark: fio write Command: fio --name=seqwrite --rw=write --bs=128k --size=4g --end_fsync=1 --loops=4 # aggrb tput Rationale: Measure the performance of a single threaded streaming write of a reasonably large file. The aim is to measure how well the file system and platform can sustain a write workload, which will depend on how well it can group and dispatch writes. It's difficult to benchmark buffered file system writes in both a short duration and in a repeatable way, as performance greatly depends on if and when the pagecache begins to flush dirty data. As a workaround, an fsync() at the end of the benchmark is called to ensure that flushing will always occur, and the benchmark also repeats four times. While this provides a much more reliable measurement, it is somewhat worst-case (applications don't always fsync), providing closer to a minimum rate – rather than a maximum rate – that you should expect.	c1455f97314fea79f7e8a1ee66777f24

MAMMUT wanted to transfer years of extreme experiences and expeditions into the urban context, to deal with the most hostile conditions that the city also carries. A cutting-edge garment: 100% waterproof, without seams and without any risk of feather loss. It is the first down jacket in the world made with an innovative technology such as the “laser fused”. The Photics collection was launched in winter 2019 with an initial limited edition of 500 pieces including men and women. The video, produced for the worldwide launch of the men collection, creates an analogy between some of the most extreme and adverse conditions that can occur in the Outdoor world - of which Mammut is a deep expert - and the most severe weather conditions that can be faced in the city. Close-up footages and focus on details emphasize the technical features of the garment, still highlighting the fashion appeal.	e50475c69053c266d4dd8ee986a35f54

				My names is Justus Fitzsimmons, Scott asked me to help the Wasatch Speed Goat blog to post race results and updates about the trail running scene! Here’s a little about myself. I’m 16 years old and I live in Lehi, Utah. I’m pretty new to ultra running. I’ve run and finished Antelope Island 50k, Squaw Peak 50 miler, and the gut wrenching speed goat 50k. I run cross country for my high school. I met Scott while helping at speed goat 50k last year and I paced him through part of Wasatch 100. And that’s how I got hooked into this! Hopefully I will be able to post a lot of stuff. But with school and work it can be pretty hard! Also, I’m a second year team member for the Wasatch Speed Goats!	4cded7d3492c755ed9f4f9249a263fe9

				A recent court case supported the definitive answer on what happens when you win a lawsuit and wonder if it’s taxable. The answer? Are you ready? … IT DEPENDS! If you are awarded a settlement because of a physical injury or illness, the proceeds are not taxable. In a recent court case, an individual was fired from her job and filed a suit against her employer that resulted in a lump-sum settlement. The individual failed to include the settlement amount in her gross income despite having received a Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income, from her former employer. The individual’s argument was that the funds were compensation for emotional distress and, therefore, excludable from her gross income. The Court said “no way” because damages for emotional distress no longer qualify for exclusion as medical compensation. In this case, the amount awarded was taxable.	a5fbb2fa717d10b99ac9dafc9dee2a77

In this case, patients have their best chance for successful treatment and improved quality of life.

				Did Sean Payton Reveal This Is Drew Brees’ Final Season? Did Saints head coach accidentally let the cat out of the bag yesterday that this would be Drew Brees' last season? It seems so, as Payton was on ESPN's Get Up yesterday morning where he said to the host, Mike Greenberg, that Brees announced he is coming back for his final season. The conversation came up as ESPN asked Payton what Taysom Hill's role would be on the team. What is confusing is that Drew just signed a two-year deal worth $50 million dollars. So why would he sign a two-year deal if this is going to be his final year? If it is for a fact Brees' final season, it will be his 15th year as quarterback for the Saints. Reports also came out a day or so ago that Drew was already being courted by ESPN and Monday Night Football to be a analyst once Drew's playing career is over.
