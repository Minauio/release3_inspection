1,138 hours
Apparently, it takes 10,000 hours to become a master of something. By that definition I think most of us are masters at sleeping and eating. I’m not sure what else I can claim though.
Yes Friends has been in the making since October 2020. At the time of writing, I reckon it’s taken 1,138 hours (roughly). We’re 10% of our way to that illusive “master” status.
But in the midst of the scrappiness of start-up life, I’ve watched masters at work. They’ve been behind the digital canvas at 3am. Writing emails to countless journalists. Running around London on photoshoots. And most recently making a film.
Today, as well as launching our T-shirt campaign, we’re releasing that film.
It’s made by Zac, Ben & Gabriel. Collectively they have more experience behind the camera than most of us do breathing. And as I watched their meticulous care over each shot, I knew I was watching masters at work. Who knew it takes 2 hours to shoot 10 seconds of video?! Not me.
So here it is, a film about Yes Friends, made by masters. It marks the start of our 30 day campaign selling 3,000 T-shirts."	cb1bf12005b56b113e866cde576787dc

My Role:
Lead Outreach Copywriter
Project goal:
E-valley needed to reach top executives at firms in the hopes of convincing (converting) them into moving their merch and distribution centers to Paris, France (where E-valley is located).
One of the outreach methods was cold emails.
Cold email outreach to senior executives and heads of logistics departments.
Since the e-valley team was French, they needed some help with English, and with overall low opening rates.
Every good email needs to be opened before it’s read.
Even if you write the best email of your life, the body of your email won’t matter if the recipient isn’t interested in opening it.
Back in January 2020, before the pandemic started, I moved to Paris, as I was hired by e-valley, the biggest E-logistics park in Europe, to help them convert more emails into actual leads.
David, their CEO, told me: “Listen, Tom, these are 7 figure leaders, heads of logistic departments for 8 figure brands, they don’t check their email, they have a secretary for that”.

Project partners include Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, North Carolina State University, UNC Chapel Hill, University of Rhode Island, and the UNC Coastal Studies Institute (UNC CSI). The project will endeavor to understand the dominant forcing mechanisms of exchange across the shelf through the deployment of a variety of oceanographic observing platforms in combination with numerical simulations.

				"Due date estimation guidelines
Compelling evidence shows that the most accurate estimation of when a normal pregnancy (gestation) will end is the projected date yielded by the mostly routine first trimester ultrasound (up until 13 weeks, 6 days).
As it turns out, the old-school estimated date of delivery (EDD), worked from the last normal menstrual period (LNMP), correlates very well with this ultrasound estimate – providing that accurate information about a woman’s LNMP is available. The LNMP EDD is worked out as follows:
- Take the date the last normal menstrual period started (LMP) – e.g. 3 March 2019
- Add nine calendar months to this date – e.g. 3 December 2019
- Add seven days and you have an expected due date – e.g. 10 December 2019
Gestational term classification
When correlating data on birth outcomes, both positive and negative, using the concept of ‘term gestation’ as 37-42 weeks (as has been adhered to for decades), has presented many challenges in the past. For the purpose of uniformity, data collection and reporting, the following useful recommendations for classification of gestational term from 37 weeks of pregnancy have been made (ACOG, 2019), and prove to be far closer to physiological labour and birth norms:
- Early term: 37 weeks, 0 days – 38 weeks, 6 days
- Full term: 39 weeks, 0 days – 40 weeks, 6 days
- Late term: 41 weeks, 0 days – 41 weeks, 6 days
- Post-term: 42 weeks, 0 days and beyond"	81a21e1bc63c6e4a029f600a01d9d769

I have a good amount of cocobolo and it has been my choice for stock knives handles so far. I also have a good amount of tiger maple, blond and reddish.

Rationale: Measure the performance of a single threaded streaming write of a reasonably large file. The aim is to measure how well the file system and platform can sustain a write workload, which will depend on how well it can group and dispatch writes. It's difficult to benchmark buffered file system writes in both a short duration and in a repeatable way, as performance greatly depends on if and when the pagecache begins to flush dirty data. As a workaround, an fsync() at the end of the benchmark is called to ensure that flushing will always occur, and the benchmark also repeats four times. While this provides a much more reliable measurement, it is somewhat worst-case (applications don't always fsync), providing closer to a minimum rate – rather than a maximum rate – that you should expect."	c1455f97314fea79f7e8a1ee66777f24

				"Harry Redknapp says he cannot sell Luka Modric - and if he did, Tottenham would be 'finished'.
The diminutive midfielder has been the subject of intense transfer speculation for well over a year and came close to leaving Spurs last summer.
Chelsea had three bids rejected and despite being told by the player that he wanted out, Spurs' hardline stance - together with Modric being under contract until 2016 - meant no move happened.
But the debate over Modric's future refuses to go away and only last week Redknapp appeared to insinuate that the Croatian could go this summer, with both Manchester clubs keen.
""I would be lying if I said I was sure that Luka would say - you don't know,"" said Redknapp last week.
""You would like to think Luka will still be here, but you never know.""
However, Redknapp has now suggested that Spurs' hopes of sustaining success in the Premier League would be over if they let Modric go.
Tottenham are talking with Modric's advisors over a pay-rise at the club and Redknapp said: ""I don't know where he is at on the contract.
""He knows what I think of him. He is a great pro. You can't replace him with someone as good. We can't sell him.
""Once you start selling your best players you are finished. He is up there with the top players in world football. You need people like him. You need good pros and good characters.""

“Most importantly, we also found that patterns of plant diversity across a region correspond closely with levels of arthropod diversity and can be used to predict it. This adds support to a focus on conserving plant diversity and, along with it, arthropod diversity.”
Raphael and his CSIRO colleagues are now exploring new ways of mapping regional biodiversity that are less resource-intensive and time-consuming.

The capacity of my stomach is greatly reduced 20 months after I started my first Whole30, and I’ve worked hard to change my relationship with food, how I view food, and the reasons I eat food. Every now and then, however, I still get the urge to eat more than I need. To just gorge myself. I don’t act on these impulses, but they still happen.
They are a hold-over from 48 years of bad eating habits and not caring about what I put into my mouth. Like muscle memory for athletes, it’s a psychological rut my mind settles into every now and then. I’ve found that it mostly happens when I am bored or not doing anything in particular, and that if I occupy my mind with something, the desire to eat goes away. That’s how I know it’s not hunger or a standard craving.
I was asked today if I wanted to eat some flan, and I said no. The person offering it said, “Sometimes, you just gotta have some because it’s what you want.” I patted my belly and said, “But I want a six-pack more than I ever want flan!” We laughed, but it’s true.

Zach Glasser has put up with a lot for the sport he loves. Endless days on the road, playing half-decent baseball in front of half-full stadiums and endless nights alone, pretending this is the life he’s always wanted.

So usually when I read sports romances, even though I know pretty much nothing about the sport, I can enjoy the novel very well. And I know even less about baseball than say ice hockey or football. But for this one, baseball is equally important as the romance and that impaired my enjoyment. I think you’d love this even more if you’re a fan of baseball.

If you are awarded a settlement because of a physical injury or illness, the proceeds are not taxable. In a recent court case, an individual was fired from her job and filed a suit against her employer that resulted in a lump-sum settlement. The individual failed to include the settlement amount in her gross income despite having received a Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income, from her former employer. The individual’s argument was that the funds were compensation for emotional distress and, therefore, excludable from her gross income.

				"The art of manifestation is an understanding of what is known as “The Law of Attraction,” the universal law that says you have the power within you to bring about your desires. On the one hand, manifestation is simple because you only have to decide what you want and then open yourself to it. On the other hand, manifestation is also challenging because to get the greatest results, you need to make a daily practice of thinking positively, trusting in the Life Force of the Universe and visualizing what you want to bring into your life. Practice the Law of Attraction with our popular “Little Reminders: The Law of Attraction Deck.”
Here are some things Amy and I do each day that helps us manifest what we desire:
Be grateful! Remind yourself not to judge yourself and every situation and person that you encounter. Concentrate on staying in the present moment since we create our future only from present-minded thinking. Quieting thoughts through prayer and meditation helps us to strengthen our spiritual connection. Light a candle to represent the light of visualization—the art of seeing your goal not only with your inner sight, but also feeling it as if you were really there, experiencing it with all of your senses can help you manifest.

				"Refactoring is an important activity in the evolutionary development of object-oriented software systems. Yet, several questions about the practice of refactoring remain unanswered, such as what fraction of code modifications are refactorings and what are the most frequent types of refactorings. To gain some insight in this matter, we conducted a detailed case study on the structural evolution of Eclipse, an integrated-development environment (IDE) and a plugin-based framework. Our study indicates that 1) about 70% of structural changes may be due to refactorings; 2) for about 60% of these changes, the references to the affected entities in a component- based application can be automatically updated by a refactoring- migration tool if the relevant information of refactored components can be gathered through the refactoring engine; and 3) stateof- the-art IDEs, such as Eclipse, support only a subset of commonly applied low-level refactorings and lack support for more complex ones, which are also frequent. Based on our findings, we draw some conclusions on high-level design requirements for a refactoringbased development environment.

When cancer is diagnosed early, it likely hasn’t had the chance to spread and metastasize. In this case, patients have their best chance for successful treatment and improved quality of life.

				"Adaptive splitting methods for nonlinear Schrödinger equations in the semiclassical regime
The error behavior of exponential operator splitting methods for nonlinear Schrödinger equations in the semiclassical regime is studied. For the Lie and Strang splitting methods, the exact form of the local error is determined and the dependence on the semiclassical parameter is identified. This is enabled within a defect-based framework which also suggests asymptotically correct a posteriori local error estimators as the basis for adaptive time stepsize selection. Numerical examples substantiate and complement the theoretical investigations.

Did Saints head coach accidentally let the cat out of the bag yesterday that this would be Drew Brees' last season?
It seems so, as Payton was on ESPN's Get Up yesterday morning where he said to the host, Mike Greenberg, that Brees announced he is coming back for his final season. The conversation came up as ESPN asked Payton what Taysom Hill's role would be on the team.
What is confusing is that Drew just signed a two-year deal worth $50 million dollars. So why would he sign a two-year deal if this is going to be his final year? If it is for a fact Brees' final season, it will be his 15th year as quarterback for the Saints.

I have to praise Yuck for sticking around and even releasing a follow-up to their fuzz-drenched 2011 debut. Daniel Blumberg, the frontman for the band, left earlier this year.

This is unfortunate, because of the circumstances (and I think promoting within shows a real sense of unity and confidence amongst members), but Blumberg’s nasally snare sounded far better in 90’s jams than Bloom’s lower, clearer vocals do. They’re channeling some more unremarkable 90’s bands now. The intentions are there, but “Glow and Behold” is both musically and vocally a disappointment to their legendary debut.

				"My sisters idea of 'italian' food and mediterranian diet was lots of whole grains (bagels, breads, pizza, lasagne and spaghetti) all cooked in olive oil (which turns rancid when heated) and lots of tomatos (nightshade family).
The mediterranian diet as advertised in america and central europe (not italy, spain or east coast of france) is actually very toxic and unhealthy and will eventually lead to several health problems later in life.
My sister (who lives in germany and followed the so called mediterranian diet for the past 20 years) is fat, lost most of her hair, has brittle teeth, aching joints with arthritis, cartilage completely broken down, lower back aches, lump in breast, swollen thyroid, allergies out the yinyang and is pre-diabetic.
Just eat PRIMAL and instead of eating a lot of red meat, just eat a lot of fish and a ton of salads...and that would be your italian cuisine.
With that, you could make your cheat a slice of multi-grain bread once a week (no wheat) and baked with butter, not oil."	690d97c9d7c7d8720688d06decd0169d

				"Like we’ve heard from others, the idea that a city’s cultural offerings drive talent acquisition for a region, the conversation continues.
[In a conversation with] with Steve Yasko, General Manager of the public radio station WTMD, I started by suggesting there was a talent gap in town and I wondered whether he thought Baltimore’s cultural scene could help.
“The leadership of the city keeps chasing the ‘creative class’ without really understanding what the city needs to do to attract them.” For Steve, culture drives talent. And civic leadership beyond proclamations and photo ops matters. “We lack a significant and overt support of the independent music community and arts culture.”
To the question of what the city should do, Steve answers, “greater investment and recognition of music events not headlined by Katie Perry, the Beach Boys or Blake Shelton.” Steve acknowledges there are moments of support, “we’re thrilled that the city has recognized First Thursday concerts in the park.”

Lavanya Tripathi has become one of the first south India film actresses to demand a CBI investigation into the death by suicide of Sushant Singh Rajput. The 'Arjun Suravaram' actress on Wednesday took to Twitter to say that the case should go to the central investigation agency.
""Don’t know what's the truth but definitely want Sushant’s case to go to CBI,"" Lavanya tweeted out. Her demand comes in the wake of several new developments in the case, especially with the Maharashtra police suspected to be trying to cover it up somehow.
