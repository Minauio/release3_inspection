At the fan meeting held for Final Fantasy XIII-2 in Tokyo over the weekend, Kitase, who’s producer on the Fabula Nova Crystallis series where Versus comes from, noted that “for Type-0 and Versus XIII we are giving 100% to development.”
Back in July this year, game director Tetsuya Nomura said that the game had yet to enter production, even after being announced at E3 2006 five years ago.
A new seven minute trailer mixed of CG and gameplay aired back in January. The game won’t be at TGS in any form this week.
Kitase also touched upon the quickness of the release of FFXIII-2, saying it’s down to the reletively brief development time the game has had, as well as know how from work on FFXIII itself.

				"A funny thing happened in the field of anatomy during the first half of this year. Researchers found a previously unknown human body part. It's inside the eyeball, and it's very small. At 15 microns thick, the newly discovered layer of material is so small that even calling it a new body part feels inappropriate. That's what it is, though. A new body part. Right there in your eye.
Named for Harminder Dua, the ophthalmology professor who made the discovery, the Dua layer is one of six known layers of the cornea. (The cornea is the transparent lens in the front of your eyeball that focuses light going in towards your brain.) Now that we know about this additional layer, researchers say that doctors will be better able to diagnose and treat certain conditions, especially injuries to the cornea. The discovery will also make corneal transplants easier. Said Dua, humbly, ""This is a major discovery that will mean that ophthalmology textbooks will literally need to be re-written.""
So keep that in mind, med school hopefuls. Your books will not only be expensive, they'll be incomplete. And yes, you should've taken that year off to go backpacking around South America, because who knows how many new body parts will be discovered in the second half of this year!

A randomized controlled trial that was recently published compared EFT to Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET). The investigators gave 60 traumatized male Iraqi students either EFT, NET, or no treatment. They found that ""EFT was more effective than NET,"" It produced steeper reductions in PTSD symptoms, and the results held over time. EFT was also significantly more effective than NET at reducing anxiety and depression symptoms.

				"Compressing screws separate solid matter from liquidity. They
work continuously and fully-automatic. Thin as well as viscid mixtures
can be separated. The mixture of solid matter or liquidity comes through
the inlet into the conical screw shaft which conveys it through the
horizontal sieve. Part of the water flows through the sieve due to
gravity. The screw transports the remaining water containing the solid
matter into the press zone in the last section of the sieve. There, a
compact stable cake is formed which permanently reforms itself and
is pressed out of the outlet when dry. Compression screws are e.g. used
to drain grass or the waste of an extraction."	4907b43654f071d7fc42509334415e69

				"Q. My grandchildren are coming for a week and I am concerned about how to entertain them. My budget has been hit hard lately and I can’t afford Disneyland and the other theme parks. What do you suggest?
How about a week of “Grandma Camp”? Think of all the things you did when you were their age.
If you have any granddaughters, let them play dress-up. If you don’t have anything at home, hit the local thrift shop. Old wedding dresses can always be found there, along with myriad other treasures.
Here are some other suggestions to prod your memory. If it’s too hot to go outside, they can play cards — “Old Maid,” “Go Fish” or “Rummy” are easy ones. With just paper and pencil, they can play “Hangman” or the “Dots and Lines” game, where you draw a grid of dots and then take turns connecting the dots to make squares. You can write a long word on a piece of paper and they can see how many shorter words they can make out of the letters. You can get a large jigsaw puzzle and set it up on a card table so it can be worked on by everyone all week."	d912b7575a9b277d024ff6df47561acf

				"A MAN who trolled the parents of Julen Rosello, the tot who died down a well, has defended his comments as ‘jokes’.
Victoria and Jose, the mum and dad of the two-year-old, denounced the poet, Camilo de Ory, for ‘degrading treatment’ after his sick tweets taunting them.
His remarks included: “Hey, what do I say? I think the child could also dig a little.
“To top it off, Julen’s father had put sausage in the paella.
“Julen, how could you have fallen so low?”
The comments were made during the 13 days Julen was trapped in the well in Totalan, after he fell in on January 13.
But de Ory, who won the Emilio Prado de Poesia Prize for his poetry in 2005, claimed he was merely using black humour.
He said: “I claim and I think you can trivialise everything.
“Humour has no limits, but my aim was not to offend those parents but to hyperbolise the media circus that had been mounted around the case of that child.
“During those days I received hundreds, even thousands, of threatening messages, some even of death.”
If found guilty of the crime of ‘degrading treatment’ the controversial poet could face a prison sentence of between six months to two years.
De Ory has not yet been summoned by the Court No. 6 of Madrid."	4e4def2c3bfbcfac2744a55c611050db

				"NEW YORK (AP) â Horror and alarm over the discovery of what appeared to be the body of a dead baby at a New York City park turned to relief, and probably some embarrassment, Tuesday when the blue-skinned corpse was later revealed to be a realistic-looking doll.
Police and paramedics rushed to Crocheron Park in the Bayside neighborhood of Queens at around 7:40 a.m. after a woman out for a morning jog found the âbabyâ lying face-down in the grass.
Detectives descended on the park in droves to look

 for evidence. A crime scene tent was set up. Yellow tape blocked off the area where the discovery was made.
Police initially reported the child was three months old and had been pronounced dead at the scene of an undetermined cause.
At some point, though, a closer inspection showed the object in the grass was a doll or some sort of theatrical prop, with its skin apparently purposely colored to resemble decomposing skin.
One giveaway was the babyâs T-shirt, which read, âthe crawling dead.â
The r
...
d lettering wasnât initially visible because the doll was on its stomach.
âIt appeared to be a baby with discoloration consistent with signs of prolonged death, but thankfully, it was actually a lifelike prop,â Fire Department spokesman Myles Miller said.
The error was discovered when personnel from the cityâs medical examiner arrived to retrieve the body.
Police said the episode is under investigation. The Fire Departmentâs Emergency Medical Service was also doing a medical review, Miller said."	f37a80c947ad2354ded7fd6aa0f83d37

What I did was fry a chopped onion, some ginger and garlic, then about 1 tablespoon of the Spice Road to India paste. About a cup of cooked and chopped spinach, 5 baby potatoes peeled and halved or quartered, a cup of water and a teaspoon of tomato paste went in. I simmered this until the potatoes cooked and the liquid was almost gone then added some halved cherry tomatoes, cream, salt and a bit of sugar. Simmered this a bit longer.

I must admit to being amazed, and impressed, with the selection and choice of unconventional, coloured wedding dresses available, it’s a clear sign of the demand for them – for brides today wanting to create a unique look and wedding that expresses their style and personality, they have plenty of gowns and dresses to choose from!

				"After months of lobbying by a Latino coalition and weeks of wrangling among councilmen, the Long Beach City Council has approved a redistricting proposal that should help put a Latino on the board for the first time.
Responding to a dramatic jump in the city's Latino population and the threat of a lawsuit by Latino activists, the council redrew the boundaries of the 1st District to give it a Latino majority.

Kell, pointing out that the new 7th District is one-fourth Asian, said that was the best the council could do without adding more seats to the council.
There were angry words over the transfer of Bluff Park from Edgerton's district to Drummond's. Not only did that remove some disaffected voters from Edgerton's district, it also removed challenger Alan Lowenthal."	5e7ea026db06860884ae12180adf9a48
				"People have raised questions over Batman’s sexuality, given his fondness for tight-fitting Lycra, secret identities, and young male companions.
But there are no questions over DC’s new lead character, Midnighter – he’s gay and proud.
The superhero is to take the lead in a DC comics series this summer, written by Steve Orlando – making him DC’s only gay lead, after Batwoman stepped back into the shadows.
The bio-engineered superhuman was created in 1998, and married his husband Apollo in a union which had (intentional) echoes of Batman and Superman’s friendship.
He also used his superhuman healing powers to recover from AIDS in just six weeks, as well as attempting to assassinate Hitler.
Apart from his love life, Midnighter’s main interest is really extreme violence – he moves so quickly he’s almost impossible to defeat in combat, and has a fondness for ripping out people’s spines.
Orlando says, ‘Midnighter was a huge character for me when I was young. Showed me there was no one way to be confident, LGBT and awesome.

Since 2006, Warner Larson has been working with the Town of Weston on multiple active recreation and park

These include a new synthetic turf field at Weston High School, a 5-field Little League complex at Burchard Park, renovation of tennis courts and several natural grass fields with new irrigation systems. Alphabet field is a new 3-field natural grass youth soccer configuration that includes a sand slit and underdrain system to maximize the playability of this field located within the 100-year floodplain adjacent to an intermittent stream and wetland.

Overview
This outpatient procedure numbs the arm and hand with an injection of local anesthetic. Typically, it is used before or after surgery on the elbow, forearm or hand.
Preparation
The patient lies down to expose the armpit. The area is cleaned and sterilized, and a local anesthetic is administered to numb the tissue at the injection site.
Locating the Nerves
The provider uses ultrasound or an electrical nerve stimulator to locate the brachial plexus nerves and the axillary artery, which pass through the upper arm. A needle is carefully guided through the armpit and down to the nerves.
Numbing the Nerves
Anesthetic is slowly injected through the needle, bathing the nerves and temporarily blocking sensation in the arm.
After Care
The numbing sensation will last for several hours after the injection. The arm will be placed in a sling until the nerve block wears off. When the anesthesia wears off, painkillers may be needed to alleviate pain from the procedure."	efc83b555bf799a309b459bdc89d22d1

A unique floral, radiant, fresh and green combination. In the cold, mint becomes stronger than rose; in the heat, a rose scent fills the air combined with a touch of freshness.
Carrière Frères candles come in a range of singular scents inspired by exotic or indigenous oils that fascinated the botanists and explorers of the 18th century. When melted, the wax releases the poetic “language of flowers and nature” thanks to finest quality ingredients.

The National Unity Government (NUG) issued a statement on April 8 that the regime killed 132 children under the age of 18 just over a year.
As of April 4, the military had killed 132 children under the age of 18 and arrested 216 children. One of those sentenced to death was a youngster under the age of 15.
As the military council could not find a man they want in Ahlone Township, Yangon on April 4, a 4-year-old boy was taken hostage and his whereabouts are unknown.
If the members of regime are not able to arrest those who they want, the family’s children and elderly relatives are being held hostage, which means the regime is committing war crimes, the NUG said.
As the military council’s actions violate Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the NUG government has stated that that it will do everything possible to bring the military council to justice.

According to the study's author ""We see very negative attitudes, a strong desire for social distance, high levels of discrimination and low support for policies that could improve access to treatment."" If you want to be President, you should have a plan for safeguarding the rights of all Americans--even those with addiction.

 the central question we should be asking all candidates, then let me rephrase: what are they going to do to improve public health, the economy, national security, civil rights, crime, family life, and education?

				"There’s a new book on the Trinity that I’m looking forward to picking up in a couple of months. Andres J. Köstenberger and Scott R. Swain have coauthored Father, Son and Spirit: The Trinity and John’s Gospel, volume 24 in the New Studies in Biblical Theology (NSBT) series, edited by D. A. Carson. It’s 224 pages and due to be released sometime in July.
Here’s how Köstenberger summarizes the book:
Part One situates John’s trinitarian teaching within the context of Second Temple Jewish monotheism. Part Two examines the Gospel narrative in order to trace the characterization of God as Father, Son and Spirit, followed by a brief synthesis. Part Three deals more fully with major trinitarian themes in the Fourth Gospel, including its account of Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, and mission. A final chapter discusses the significance of John’s Gospel for the church’s doctrine of the Trinity, and a brief conclusion summarizes some practical implications."	f373d0694aa8dfcc8798965ddd9d50e4

For the first time, there is a budget line specifically earmarked for Land Bank seizures in the 2025 fiscal year proposal from the Mayor’s Office; this would provide the Land Bank with $300k for that purpose if approved.
Additionally, Wright commended city officials for deploying new strategies to accelerate the process of foreclosing tax-delinquent properties.

				"Doyle, Peter (2002) Ireland and the Nice Treaty. ZEI Discussion Paper: 2002, C 115. [Discussion Paper]
Abstract
[Introduction.] The experience in Ireland of conducting two referenda on the Nice Treaty: Just for the record, let me remind you that the first referendum was held in June 2001, when the result was just under 54% against and just over 46% per cent in favour. The turnout was just under 35%, the second lowest in the history of referenda in Ireland and by far the lowest in referenda relat
... 
on October 19 last, there was a dramatic turn-around; 63% said ""yes"", 37% ""no"" and 51% of the electorate failed to vote. Those among you who possess agile mathematical minds will be able to work out pretty quickly that the ""no"" vote changed little between the two referenda; from just over 20% of the vote the first time to around 18% last month. The key to the positive result the second time around, therefore, was the higher turnout, even though half of the electorate stayed away from the polls. 
...
to be well disposed towards the EU and who abstained last year actually turned out this time. You might well wonder why a country which has enjoyed such largesse from the EU’s coffers should appear to be so reluctant to vote in favour of further integration and enable our less-fortunate neighbours in central and eastern Europe to share in the same good fortune. Had the EU not, after all, been a major factor in the creation of the phenomenon which has come to be known as the Celtic Tiger economy."	adab589238cf235cbe6a81c10ddba93b

Industry-Standard Benchmarking of ES7000 Begins

Late last month, Unisys published audited results on the mySAP.com

Unisys brand name for its version of the CMP server.
Unisys' 32-processor capable CMP systems have been on the market for

late March 2000 by Compaq with an eight-processor Windows 2000 Advanced
Server with SQL Server 2000. That system had 25 eight-way application
servers in the middle tier.
By doubling up on database processors and application servers,
Unisys beat Compaq's number by about 40 percent.

The Big Iron approach with Unisys is one of two approaches to
scalability Microsoft is pursuing. The other approach is horizontal
scaling, which involves clustering many systems together. Microsoft and
Compaq used that approach to vault to the top of the TPC-C raw
performance benchmarks in February 2000, and the pair retains the top
performance spot for clustered systems. Microsoft, however, has not
shown any customer implementations of even two-node database
clusters.

There is a significant economic advantage to the application of Muslim law in regards to the amputation of a thief’s hand, as well as the stoning of adulterers, the doctor said.

				"Stress fractures often are the result of increasing the amount or intensity of an activity too rapidly. They also can be caused by the impact of an unfamiliar surface, improper equipment and increased physical stress. Most stress fractures occur in the weight bearing bones of the lower leg and the foot and are most commonly seen in the following sports – tennis, track and field, gymnastics, and basketball. This is because in these sports, the repetitive stress of the foot striking the ground can cause trauma. Without sufficient rest between workouts or competitions, an athlete is at risk for developing a stress fracture.
Pain with activity is the most common complaint. The pain subsides with rest."	822504c7f585b05baa4da05fe3be0f85

Has your child dropped the ‘F' word yet? No, not the naughty Gordon Ramsay one... The rather more contentious and difficult to deal with one - ‘fair'.
Nine year olds are often incredibly preoccupied with fairness, and unfortunately anything which they perceive to be as unfair is met with a chorus of disapproval.
Ask them to lay the table?
""But that's not fair!"" (You may well hear them whine)
""I laid the table yesterday - it shouldn't always be me doing it!""
Sound familiar?
How should

d of them (and hopefully at least) they'll be less rows over what's fair and what isn't. If you like you can also run a reward scheme whereby they can save up points for a treat of some sort. This might come in handy if there are extras which you'd like them to do - perhaps an extra task would mean bonus points earned!
But what about dealing with the concept of fairness more generally?
The truth is that sometimes life just isn't fair; and children need to understand that. So what should you do?

However, it's probably not the ‘right' thing to do.
I teach my children that regardless of the situation it's never ok to hit anyone; and if they do retaliate and hit back, they may well find themselves dealt the same punishment as the child who hit them in the first place.
Trying to get your child to focus on doing the ‘right' thing rather than becoming overly preoccupied with fairness will help them to develop maturity, and help them become better at handling these sorts of situations."	47273dc03cab310a3812927ad0c97b65

				"Some people around Grass Valley have a difficult time following the rules and as a result end up back in jail. Grass valley Police Sgt Jason Perry says that suspects with outstanding warrants for other crimes were were arrested for possession of drug related items, evading officers, and theft. The first arrest involved drug activity and two vehicles on Mill Street Thursday.
The suspect Trent Crovo was found to be on searchable probation.*
Crovo was in possession of over a half gram of suspected heroin.
A second incident involved a suspect familiar to Grass Valley law enforcement.
The officer circled the block and attempted to make contact with the suspect, Paul Dempster.
Dempster was arrested for resisting arrest and his outstanding warrants.
The third incident involved a suspected shoplifter at the Quikstop on Hughes Road.
The suspect was identified as Kaetlin Sulley who had several warrants for her arrest.
A store employee was able to retrieve the stolen property so theft was not included with Sulley’s charges.
Two additional suspects were also arrested by police or sheriff officers for probation violations and warrants following traffic stops for vehicle violations.

				"From the nation’s military point of view, according to one military intelligence official who spoke anonymously to the press corps, even a veto-proof congressional majority elected in 2008 is unlikely to demand a full, immediate military withdrawal from Iraq. Instead, any withdrawal will be staggered to preserve the most stable situation possible in the hopes of preventing internal chaos. The military’s best possible scenario, as this official forecast, is to “get (Iraq) as stable as we can, wit

Does a complete and immediate military pullout of U.S. troops make any kind of sense? Most likely not. A phased withdrawal may well be in the best interests of Iraq and of the U.S. troops stationed there. And most Democrats advocating pulling out of Iraq agree that a phased wit

It should be clear to Americans, by now, that Bush and his neoconservative cohorts will not change course even in the face of overwhelming evidence. Only the majority’s voice, spoken loudly and clearly, will guide this nation out of Iraq and direct the country’s military resources to more effective use."	2f362ac523ebf14431382d7f9546ffd3

				"The Sitka Hybrid Scouting Shirt... Guys, we can never say enough good things about this outdoor button down shirt. This Sitka long sleeve shirt has to be hands down one of our most anticipated and favorite piece in the Sitka Spring line. Picture your favorite fishing shirt, add some odor control and moisture wicking, plus some 4-Way Stretch Sleeves and you've got the most comfortable long sleeve performance shirt on the planet. They call this Sitka long sleeve shirt the Scouting shirt because this would be the perfect shirt to wear during the off-season checking migration routes, picking up sheds, and more but to be honest, this would even make a pretty solid top to hunt in as well!
The BEST part about the Hybrid Scouting Shirt has to be the 4-way stretch sleeves. It doesn't sound like much but when it comes to getting down and dirty, it's nice to be able to simple slide your sleeves up instead of messing with rolling them and tucking them up, just to have them fall the second you start to move around. The durable but soft nylon body stands up to wear and tear where you need it while knit panels and sleeves provide breathability and smooth range of motion
Need more convincing? Let this outdoor button down shirt do the talking.
